Okay, imagine you have a special toy that makes a sound when you press a button. Your big sibling already has a similar toy that also makes a sound.

Now, let's say your big sibling shows you how to change the sound of the toy by opening it and putting in a different button that makes a new sound. They tell you that you can do this because the toy you have is a bit like theirs.

In Java, when you have a special class that's a bit like another class, you can change how a special action works in a similar way. This special action is like the sound the toy makes. When you change how the action works in your special class to be 
different from the original class, you're "overriding" it. Just like you changed the button to make a different sound, you're changing how the action happens in your class.

So, "override" in Java means changing or making a new way for something to happen in your special class, when it's already happening in a similar way in another class.
