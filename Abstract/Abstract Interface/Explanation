n Java, an interface is a programming construct that defines a contract of methods that a class implementing the interface must adhere to. 
It specifies a set of method signatures (methods with their names, return types, and parameters) without providing any implementation. 
Classes that implement an interface are then required to provide concrete (i.e., implemented) versions of those methods.

Here are key characteristics and rules associated with interfaces in Java:

    Declaration: To declare an interface, you use the interface keyword, followed by the interface's name and a list of method declarations.

    Abstract Methods: In an interface, all methods are implicitly abstract, which means they don't have a method body. Implementing classes must provide the actual implementation for these methods.

    Public Access: All methods declared in an interface are implicitly public and abstract, and all fields (variables) are implicitly public, static, and final. You don't need to explicitly declare these modifiers.

    Multiple Inheritance: Unlike classes, Java supports multiple inheritance for interfaces. A class can implement multiple interfaces, inheriting the method contracts from each interface.

    Implementation by Classes: Classes that implement an interface must provide concrete implementations for all the methods declared in the interface. Failure to do so results in a compilation error.

    No Constructors: Interfaces cannot have constructors because they cannot be instantiated directly.

    Default and Static Methods: Starting from Java 8, interfaces can include default methods (methods with a default implementation) and static methods, allowing you to add new methods to interfaces without breaking existing implementations.
