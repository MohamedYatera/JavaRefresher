Abstract classes and interfaces in Java serve similar purposes, but they have some key differences, and the choice between them depends on the specific needs of your design.

Here are the main differences between abstract classes and interfaces:

1. **Method Implementation:**
   - **Abstract Class:** Can have abstract methods (methods without a body) as well as concrete methods (methods with implementations).
   - **Interface:** Can only declare abstract methods (prior to Java 8). Starting from Java 8, interfaces can also have default methods (methods with default implementations) and static methods.

2. **Multiple Inheritance:**
   - **Abstract Class:** Supports single inheritance. A class can extend only one abstract class.
   - **Interface:** Supports multiple inheritance. A class can implement multiple interfaces.

3. **Constructor:**
   - **Abstract Class:** Can have constructors. Subclasses are required to call a constructor of the abstract class explicitly.
   - **Interface:** Cannot have constructors because they cannot be instantiated directly.

4. **Fields (Variables):**
   - **Abstract Class:** Can have instance variables, which can be inherited by subclasses.
   - **Interface:** Can only have `public static final` constants (constants that are implicitly `static` and `final`).

5. **Usage:**
   - **Abstract Class:** Typically used when you want to provide a common base class with some default implementation and enforce a contract through abstract methods. It's useful when you have a "is-a" relationship between classes, where a subclass is a specialized version of the abstract class.
   - **Interface:** Used to define a contract or a set of methods that unrelated classes can implement. It's useful when you want to achieve a "has-a" relationship, where a class may have multiple roles or behaviors.

So, which one to use depends on your design goals:

- **Use an Abstract Class When:**
  - You want to provide a common base class with some default behavior.
  - You need to share code and state among related classes.
  - You have a "is-a" relationship between classes, where the subclass is a specialized version of the abstract class.

- **Use an Interface When:**
  - You want to define a contract that unrelated classes can implement.
  - You need to support multiple inheritance (a class can implement multiple interfaces).
  - You have a "has-a" relationship, where a class may have multiple roles or behaviors that are not related by a common base class.

In many cases, the choice between an abstract class and an interface depends on the specific requirements of your application and the design patterns you want to implement. You can also use both together when necessary, as a class can implement multiple interfaces and extend a single abstract class.
