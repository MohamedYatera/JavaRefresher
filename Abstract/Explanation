If we say "i went to go get tickets today", its vague because  we don't know what kind of tickets.
By the same token "Animals" could mean dog, cat, lion , etc...

An abstract class is used as a form of contract promising that its methods/variables will be used. The methods in the absract class dont have any body. We call those methods unimplemented

So unlike its counter part "concrete classes" you dont have to use override to change the parent code or use the same parent code.

Everthing in the abstract class has to be used
