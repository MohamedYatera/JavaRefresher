int number; // Declaring an integer variable named 'number'
int number = 42; // Initializing 'number' with the value 42
// Instantiating an object of class 'Person'
Person person = new Person();


Declaring is about specifying the type and name of a variable.
Initializing is about giving a variable its initial value at the time of declaration.
Assigning is about changing the value of a variable after it has been declared and initialized.
Instantiating is the process of creating an object of a class, which involves allocating memory and calling the constructor to initialize its state.
