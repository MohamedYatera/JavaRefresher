In java running a program happens in two steps, compilation and then execution.



At compile time, the java compiler(javac) takes the source code(.java file) and checks if there is any syntax, type-checking or any semantic errors inside the program. 
If there is no error, the compiler generates a .class(bytecode) file for that .java file. If there is any compilation error, java compiler displays that error in command window(eg cmd).

As soon as the programmer starts executing the program using java command, runtime gets started and it ends when execution of program ended either successfully or unsuccessfully. 
In other way the process of running a program is known as runtime.
