In this example:

    The Animal class has a parameterized constructor that takes a name argument.
    The Dog class is a subclass of Animal and has an additional breed field.
    When you create a Dog object, the Dog constructor is called. Inside the Dog constructor, the super(name) line calls the constructor of the Animal class, passing the name argument.
    This leads to constructor chaining, where the Animal constructor is executed before the Dog constructor.

Remember that constructors are not inherited, but they are called as part of the object creation process to ensure proper initialization of both the subclass and the superclass components.
